                <p style="text-indent: 40px">This project was very fun and intresting because we got to choose what we wanted to do. We decided to use the 3D modeling softwares called Blender and SketchUp, because one of us was experienced in Blender and the other in SketchUp.

                <br>
                <p style="text-indent: 40px">This led to an interesting mix of styles; the realism of Blender and the simplicity of SketchUp. It was very interesting to see how both of the softwares worked with each other. We think they worked out well and it turned out to be a great
                    modeling experence that could help out with our future job choices one day.

                <p style="text-indent: 40px">"Eric showed me how to model things in blender and change their texture, color, material, and overall appearence. I thought it was very interesting and I will do more with Blender. Both of us learned new things by using these softwares
                    and we tried extremely hard to make it look the best it can." - Aiden
